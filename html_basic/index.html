    <h1>Welcome to My Cool Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my first attempt at creating a structured and well-organized webpage.</p>
    
    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This webpage is a part of my portfolio project, showcasing my progress in learning HTML.</p>
    
    <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
    <p>Learning HTML has been an exciting experience. I have learned about headings, paragraphs, and linking images.</p>
    
    <p>With more practice, I aim to build more advanced webpages with CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    
    <p>Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my journey in web development.</p>
